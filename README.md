# News Feed

Uses React to build a desktop app that returns a list of articles dependent on your search query. Current requirements are to display Sports, Technology, and Entertainment, but results can be attained by typing the keywords in the search bar:

This is the beginning page.

And this is the page once a query has been inputted and articles have been fetched.

## Dependencies

Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Semantic UI React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and is powered by the [News API](https://newsapi.org/).

## Issues

The GitHub pages version currently does not work, and I unfortunately don't know how to modify the source code for it to properly function (I have looked up documentation and rerouting pages, but to no avail). At the moment, must download the repository and run `npm start` on CLI to open it at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
